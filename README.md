# Auto-Quizlet-Learn
Does Quizlet Learn automatically. Also this doesn't work if you're off the screen so just keep it running in the corner or on another monitor.
To use, go to the learn page and open the console. Then paste in whatever is in `main.js`. The script should automatically run and print the question and answer to each new card in the console. If the program stops for some reason, just paste the script into console again and it should run (this only happens if you leave the screen)

# pretty sure this only work for language quizlets due to a weird bug where you have to click the buttons when it asks you write instead of just setting the .value of the input element to the answer
